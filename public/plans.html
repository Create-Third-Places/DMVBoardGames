            Evaluating and implementing technologies for the website. Right now,
            the frontend site is built with Vite, vanilla JavaScript, and
            vanilla CSS. However, there are other options for the frontend that
            might be better. The website will also need a backend and
            alternatives to Node.js and PostgreSQL should be evaluated.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              CSS: Right now, the website is using vanilla CSS. Sass, Tailwind,
              and other CSS tools should be evaluated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vite: Vite appears to be the most popular new tool for building
              frontend assets. However, there might be other options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backend API: The website needs a backend API, and it should be
              decoupled from the UI as much as possible. There are a variety of
              programing languages and frameworks that can be used. Languages
              that would be a good fit for the backend include Elixir, Golang,
              JavaScript(Node.js), PHP, or Rust.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kubernetes or another open source container orchestration tool.
              The goal is to deploy and run the website without a dependency on
              a specific cloud provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Database creation using PostgreSQL or another open source
              relational database tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Terraform or another infrastructure as code tool to create and
              manage infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>CI/CD using Jenkins or another open source tool.</li>
