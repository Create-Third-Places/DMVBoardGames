## Contributing

Follow `Development guidelines` from [here](https://github.com/Create-Third-Places/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) to contribute to the project.

### Development Process

1. Create a branch from the latest `main`.
2. Submit a PR with your changes.
3. After the PR is merged, the changes should be verified by running locally or using the test branch. A deployment will then automatically be attempted, and changes will be visible at `https://test.dmvboardgames.com/` if the deployment is successful.
4. Once the changes are verified, a PR should be submitted from the `main` branch to the `prod` branch. Once the PR is merged, the changes will be automatically deployed to `https://dmvboardgames.com/`.

### Other guidelines

- Keep PRs as small as possible. Large features should be broken down into multiple PRs when possible.
- If a PR has UI changes, it is helpful to include a screenshot of the chagne in the PR.
